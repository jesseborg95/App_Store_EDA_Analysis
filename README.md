# App_Store_EDA_Project
Group project using R to analyze Google and Apple app stores. Exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression.

## Motivation
I performed this project as part of a group for an intro to data science class at the George Washington University. The requirements for the project were to perform exploratory data analysis on a sizable dataset of your choice using R.

## Data Source
My group chose to analyze app store datasets found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com).

## Using the Files
* The .csv files show the raw data used for the project.
* The .Rmd file shows all of my group's code. This file can be downloaded and knitted to get the final output.
* The .html file is the knitted R-Markdown file. Look at this if you are only interested in the output of the analysis. To view the rendered html file, go to http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jonathangiguere/App_Store_EDA_Project/blob/master/Project-Summary.html
